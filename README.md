# Lithia C#.net
Lithia is a programming language with rust-like syntax transpiled to c#.

### ATTENTION:
**Work will recontinue once again at the [lithia](https://github.com/DragonFIghter603/lithia) project.**
The reason for this change is that we now wull use LLVM.
This repository will now be archived. Further switches are highly unlikely, more likely old stuff will be put on archive branches.

If you have any questions, please submit them via the lithia repo or directly to me, **not this repository!**

This is the continuation of the [lithia](https://github.com/DragonFIghter603/lithia) project.
Reasons for the switch were the need for a modular token parser/AST generator,
as the old one did not hold up to standards, as well as the slow speed of the custom bytecode 
interpreter, to which lithia compiled.
