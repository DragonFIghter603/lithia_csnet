# Lithia C#.net
Lithia is a programming language with rust-like syntax transpiled to c#.

This is the continuation of the [lithia](https://github.com/DragonFIghter603/lithia) project.
Reasons for the switch were the need for a modular token parser/AST generator,
as the old one did not hold up to standards, as well as the slow speed of the custom bytecode 
interpreter, to which lithia compiled.
